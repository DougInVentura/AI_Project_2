UI Enhancement to support more models.
  The current template is limited to 3 models using the small boxes at the bottom of the page.
  Alter the UI to show a dropdown list of the models that can be selected. These models could be easily added to a table.
  That table could have the model name, description and could link to other tables for dynamic hyper parameter field definition.
  This would allow the classes that feed the next items to be created dynamically from table data.

Object Relational UI for Model Hyper Parameter collection
  Use Object relational mapping (ORM) to create a dynamic web UI that uses objects that define model hyper parameters
  collect the hyper parameters, save them to make selection easy in the future and use collected values with the models.

Object Relational preprocessing for data file columns
  Use Object relational mapping (ORM) to create a dynamic web UI that displays columns from the selected data file
  and allows the user to define preprocessing steps for each column. Save the preprocessing steps to make selection easy 
  in the future and use collected values with the models when processing the file in the future.
