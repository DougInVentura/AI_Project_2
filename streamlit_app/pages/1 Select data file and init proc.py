#       1) replace non null 'missing characters' such as "?" with pd.Nan, etc.
#       2) reduce label categories (use value counts to say how many categories and all others go into an 'other' which can get a custom name)
#               a) would help with all of the encoding and reduce dimentionality in the case of OHE.
#       3) convert any 'Object' columns that are in truth numeric to numeric (Int or Float)
